# nl
Implementation of nl bash command in Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL).
Repository contains both the original file written in SPL (nl.spl) and c file transpiled by the transpiler https://github.com/drsam94/Spl

Since reading both the spl file and the transpiled c file is hard i also provide human-written version in c (test.c), which should work exactly the same.
